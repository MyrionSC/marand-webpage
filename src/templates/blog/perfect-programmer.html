        <h1>The Perfect Programmer</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I have this picture in my head of the perfect programmer. A god of programming. It is a childish picture. In the real world, any acquisition of new skills must be weighed between the cost of acquiring them / keeping them up to date and their usefulness to you. Time and resources are finite.</p>
        <p>So the perfect programmer can never exist. But if they did, the skills below would be mastered and natural to them. The perfect programmer can:</p>
        <br>
        <p class="underheader">Write automatic tests as naturally as doing a manual tests</p>
        <p>When building software we are always testing in some form. Whether we are clicking through a GUI or calling an API through postman / curl, while making gradual changes, or writing all the tests in advance, we are testing. The perfect programmer can write a test for doing something as quickly as that thing can be done by others in hand. For instance, if the test involves clicking a button and seeing a result, while someone else would click the button in the GUI and observe the expected result, the perfect programmer will in code query the button, click it, wait for load of data, parse the returned result and verify correctness. After each task done, another set of tests are added to the testsuite, for later use in regression testing.</p>
        <p class="underheader">Do complex contextual text refactor as quickly as doing a single change by hand</p>
        <p>Every programmer edits text frequently. When editing large bodies of text, the perfect programmer can discern and describe complicated patterns, using regex or even context free grammar, and use their tooling to refactor a codebase in this way from memory.</p>
        <p class="underheader">Write a script as quickly as doing a thing by hand</p>
        <p>Most projects involve doing tasks around actually writing the main code, like changing formats of files, downloading modules or publishing binaries to distributed environments. The perfect programmer produces scripts whenever doing one of these tasks, and archives them in easily reached and indexed locations, so that they or the rest of the team can easily access and use them again. When the perfect programmer is done with any task, such as setting up a new environment or doing an operation on files, the task can be completed again by running the script. As the project proceeds, a library of scripts doing and documenting the common tasks pertaining to the project is gradually built up.</p>
        <p class="underheader">Know common modules / tooling</p>
        <p>When building software, you want to make as good use of existing open source resources as you can. Existing software in wide use is more battle tested than newly written software, and there is a possibility that colleagues, who have to support he project in the future, already knows about it, decreasing learning errors and on-boarding time. The perfect programmer has an excelent overview of what open source software exists and is proficient at modifying it and applying it to the current task. (Caveat: This only applies for tasks of some size. I am not advocating for NPM style 1 line libraries that can be replicated with 5 minutes of work here.)</p>
        <br>
        <p>The common theme in all of these are tooling. Know what tools exist and be insanely proficient at using your chosen tools.</p>
        <p>By the way, I distinguish between a programmer and a software engineer. A programmer programs things. A software engineer solves problems, which often (but not always) concern software. A good software engineer is a good programmer, as well as much more.</p>
